          Canada is the ideal place to learn English and/or French. There's a
          lot to like about this lovely and accommodating country, and there are
          a plethora of English education programs to choose from. You might
          never want to leave once you've been there!

        content: >
          Thinking about going to college abroad? Taking a college in Canada is
          a great way to settle in the country. In general, Canadian Colleges
          aim for the most practical education for those looking to be ready to
          work after completing their studies. College study programs offer
          professional training in Canada, primarily focused on career
          development. Studying at a Canadian college you are allowed to work
          legally during the studies.

        content: >
          Canada Vocational Training Courses offer training that is both
          practical and career-oriented. These professional courses are a very
          interesting choice for those who already have a good level of English.

          Studying in another country can be both inspiring and satisfying.
          Traveling to a foreign country, on the other hand, can present
          unexpected difficulties, ranging from the basic complications of a new
          diet to an unexpected illness or injury, or even a more serious
          accident while away from home. Unexpected medical costs will place you
          in a financial bind, and they can even force you to postpone your trip
          abroad. Health insurance is a must, especially when travelling abroad
          for an extended period of time.
