excerpt: >-
  Like every major destination city in North America, Toronto has several types
  of itinerary. Museums (both as an incredible natural history museum and even a
  hockey museum), zoos and aquariums. One that deserves mention is the CN tower.
  Especially for those who are not afraid of heights or want to face that fear.
  With a height of over 500 m, it is possible not only to walk outside the
  tower, but also to hang from it.
subtitle: The largest city in Canada.

Like every major destination city in North America, Toronto has several types of itineraries. Museums (both as an incredible natural history museum and even a hockey museum), zoos, and aquariums. One that deserves mention is the CN tower. Especially for those who are not afraid of heights or want to face that fear. With a height of over 500 m, it is possible not only to walk outside the tower but also to hang from it.

All of these characteristics of Toronto entice foreign students to come and study here.
Studying in Toronto is a wonderful choice for those interested in widening their horizons outside your home country: the city is incredibly welcoming to newcomers, the courses are less costly, the educational institutions are among the finest in the world, the city is stunning, and there is always the chance to immigrate.
