###### Located on the southern banks of the Ottawa River in the province of Ontario, Ottawa is the capital of Canada and one of the largest cities in the country. Ottawa is one of the best Canadian cities to live in, being a modern destination, with great educational institutions and high quality of life. It is not by chance that the city attracts many tourists and foreign visitors, many of whom are interested in establishing residence there.

###### With endless activities in both summer and winter, like boating on the **Ottawa River**, skating the **Rideau Canal** (the longest skating rink in the world) or skiing in the Gatineau’s, you’ll never find yourself bored. Ottawa hosts over 60 festivals each year including the world-famous [**Winterlude** ](https://www.ottawatourism.ca/ottawa-insider/winterlude/)celebration, [**Bluesfest** ](http://www.ottawabluesfest.ca/)and, of course, the biggest celebration of all, [**Canada Day**](https://www.ottawatourism.ca/ottawa-insider/canada-day/)!
