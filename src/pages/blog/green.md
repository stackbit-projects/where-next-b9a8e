subtitle: Stunning Rock Mountians
excerpt: >-
  Calgary, a cosmopolitan city in Alberta with several skyscrapers, owes its
  rapid growth to being the center of Canada's oil industry. Calgary is one of
  the richest, cleanest, and livable cities in Canada. Calgary residents, like
  Edmontonians, benefit from a lower cost of living, a healthy employment
  market, and low taxes. There are no federal income taxes, provincial general
  capital taxes, or local sales taxes in Alberta.

Calgary, a cosmopolitan city in Alberta with several skyscrapers, owes its rapid growth to being the center of Canada's oil industry. Calgary is one of the richest, cleanest, and livable cities in Canada. Calgary residents, like Edmontonians, benefit from a lower cost of living, a healthy employment market, and low taxes. There are no federal income taxes, provincial general capital taxes, or local sales taxes in Alberta.

Banff National Park is about 68 miles from Calgary, and ranges over 4800 km long, crosses the territory of one of the most beautiful destinations in all of North Americaâ€¦  Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada. Moraine Lake. There you have an iconic image of the beauty of the country and, perhaps, of all destinations in North America; a green lake with the valley of the ten peaks in the background.  The beautiful color of the lake is due to the fact that it is fed by a glacier, the light, when hitting the lake, reflects the wonderful color of the rocks. Giving rise to the unique color of Lake Moraine. Another interesting thing is that in the summer the day goes on until 11 pm.
